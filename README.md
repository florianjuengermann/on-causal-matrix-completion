# On Causal Matrix Completion
## MIT 6.867 project

We explore the task of matrix completion in a setting where entries are missing not at random (MNAR). Our work is based on the [Causal Matrix Completion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15154) which introduced the Synthetic Nearest Neighbors (SNN) algorithm for matrix completion. 

The implementation for the Synthetic Nearest Neighbors algorithm is based on [this repository](https://github.com/deshen24/syntheticNN) by Dennis Shen.
